# Dotfiles

This is my repository of dot-files. Mainly my configuration for `vim, emacs and i3`. I use vim mostly, but I do want to change over to `emacs` because of org-mode and other advantages. But until then, the vim configuration should work for any system that has `nodejs` installed.

If you want a minimal `.vimrc` that works on any system, click [!here](https://github.com/blank-manash/.vimrc-file).
